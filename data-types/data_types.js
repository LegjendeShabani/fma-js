// Declare and initialize 5 variables using all the data types that we learned in this session.
// These variables need to have meaningful names and should actually represent something - like using firstName for a String.

const myName = 'Legjenda';
const yearOfBirth = 1999;
let isEmployeed = true;
let age;

// Log all of these variables in the console and look at the output.

console.log(myName, yearOfBirth, isEmployeed, age);
